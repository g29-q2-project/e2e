# e2e
### end to end travel simplified.
With todays fast paced lifestyles people are commuting more with more available
options then ever before.  e2e was designed to enable users to commute more efficiently
then ever before.  By logging in common commutes users can compare different modes of
transportation and best times to travel.  This allows users to ultimately save time
and money when it comes to commuting.

We store common user commutes in a database and ping Google Maps API and Uber API various
times throughout to gather information.  We use the collected data to generate graphs to give users
a better picture of the best times and most cost effective ways to make their commutes.
Users can then contrast and compare various modes of transportation as well as various
time differences in departure time.  Making slight changes to can often have a drastic
unexpected impact for users.
